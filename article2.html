            <p>There’s no doubt about it. Blogging is a tried and true method of increasing site traffic and conversion
                rates. A blog has so much versatility, it’s one of the most important tools you can use to develop a
                community and maintain a steady stream of website traffic.</p>
            <p>But how can you make your blog worth the time it takes to create and maintain? Blogging can be
                intimidating, especially when you know how valuable a tool it can be, and it can also be frustrating if
                you’re not seeing the results everyone else seems to have.</p>
            <p>Luckily, there are plenty of things you can do to streamline your blogging and get more from your
                efforts.</p>
            <p>Here are the top five tools and techniques you can use to improve your blogging today. You’ll find that
                most of them can be implemented quickly and efficiently, so you can start seeing results
                immediately.</p>
            <p class="tip">1. Use More Visual Content</p>
            <p>Visual content is king these days, and that can be used to your advantage. Straight blocks of text can
                bore your readers and drive them away before they get a chance to see any kind of call to action. This
                directly translates to lost site traffic and lower conversion rates.</p>
            <p>Use visual content like pictures to tell a story to your reader. This keeps them engaged and interested
                in what you have to say. Remember to space pictures out and introduce them in the beginning. If the
                reader has to scroll all the way to the bottom of a post to see any pictures, you’ve already lost
                them.</p>
            <p class="tip">2. Use Survey Tools</p>
            <p>How can you know what your readers like or don’t like about your blog if you aren’t actively asking them
                for their suggestions?</p>
            <p>As you begin to understand your audience better, you’ll also begin to understand what drives them to buy,
                and you can then effectively change your approach. You can learn more about your audience using survey
                tools.</p>
            <p>Remember, while survey tools can be incredibly helpful to learn more about your audience, they can also
                quickly become a hassle to your site visitors. Always give your readers a choice when it comes to
                surveys. Forcing them to take a survey is a quick way to ensure they’ll never return to your blog.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="tip">3. Create a Consistent Editorial Approach</p>
            <p>A blog should have a story to tell. You need to decide what that story is going to be before you start
                writing it. A blog without a consistent theme or focus can feel disoriented to site visitors. People
                like consistency, and they like to know what to expect when they visit a website – and this is what we
                refer to as a content strategy.</p>
            <p>By creating a consistent editorial approach, you encourage visitors to come back to your site to read
                more useful information. Take the time to create consistency and stability in the blog content. Your
                readers will recognize the time and effort you’ve taken to create thoughtful and unique content and
                continue to read on until they see your calls to action.</p>
            <p class="tip">4. Create Clear Calls to Action</p>
            <p>Blogs are all about providing useful information, which means it’s easy for people to focus solely on
                providing the content while missing the chance to provide an effective call to action. This, in turn,
                can have a big impact on whether or not casual visitors convert to paying customers.</p>
            <p>Calls to action on blogs may consist of asking the visitor to subscribe to a newsletter or read the
                entire blog post or a wide range of other activities. If you don’t make these calls to action clear,
                site visitors will land on a page and not realize what they can do on the site or why they should do
                it. </p>
            <p>These are all things you want your visitors to be doing. Place calls to action in logical places where
                the reader will be sure to see them, but not where they interrupt the overall user experience.</p>
            <p class="tip">5. Improve Social and Sharing Options</p>
            <p>We live in a world that is constantly connected to everything and everyone. The human race likes to share
                things it finds useful, so make sure your site visitors can easily share your blog posts with their
                friends.</p>
            <p>First of all, make your share button clearly visible on each and every post on your blog. If someone
                finds the content interesting or useful, they’ll then be able to share it with all of their friends.</p>
            <p>Next, create an actual plan for distributing blog posts on social media. Each social media platform has a
                different audience, so you’ll want to plan on creating a different approach for each site.</p>

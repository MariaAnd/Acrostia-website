                            <h4>What is Marketing Analysis?</h4>
                            <p>A marketing analysis is a study of the dynamism of the market. It is the attractiveness
                                of a special market in a specific industry. Marketing analysis is basically a business
                                plan that presents information regarding the market in which you are operating in. It
                                deals with various factors.</p>
                            <p>The most common factors are the SWOT which is an acronym for; Strengths, Weaknesses,
                                Opportunities, and Threats. By assessing the company’s strengths and weaknesses, you can
                                make a strategy on which factors to focus upon. If you have a good labor force, ample
                                investment and good advertising experts then you are going to make your marketing
                                strategy focusing on those things. Similarly if your technology is comparatively poorer
                                and you lack online presence then you are going to avoid those things. <span>You also look at external factors like situations which may provide you with an opportunity or threat.  Economic factors, political instabilities or even social changes can give you opportunities which you can seize and do better. They can also create threats which are going to hamper your business dealings. Considering all these factors will give you a marketing analysis from which you can implement your decisions.</span>

                            <h4>The Importance of Design</h4>
                            <p>Great design is critical to getting traction with almost any campaign.</p>
                            <p>Campaigns are about raising the profile of brands or moving customers in a specific
                                direction to buy a company’s products or services. One of the critical elements of
                                getting people to buy is trust. Brands are essentially the way that customers code a
                                specific offering in their minds: this brand represents quality and luxury, or this
                                brand represents comfort and value. Regardless of what your target customers hold in
                                highest esteem, a brand is shorthand for that. Every piece of creative you release —
                                blog posts, brochures — says something about a brand. If the design is less than
                                professional and aligned with the brand’s core messaging, it can undermine years of work
                                and good impressions. By contrast, good design speaks volumes to a company’s
                                professionalism, quality and positioning in the market.</p>

                            <h4>Create Your Strategy</h4>
                            <p>Developing a marketing strategy is vital for any business. Without one, your efforts to
                                attract customers are likely to be haphazard and inefficient.</p>
                            <p>The focus of your strategy should be making sure that your products and services meet
                                customer needs and developing long-term and profitable relationships with those
                                customers. To achieve this, you will need to create a flexible strategy that can respond
                                to changes in customer perceptions and demand. It may also help you identify whole new
                                markets that you can successfully target. The purpose of your marketing strategy should
                                be to identify and then communicate the benefits of your business offering to your
                                target market. Once you have created and implemented your strategy, monitor its
                                effectiveness and make any adjustments required to maintain its success.</p>

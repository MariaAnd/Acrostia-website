                <h3>Most Commonly Asked Questions About Marketing</h3>
                <p class="question">1. Can social media marketing really help my business?</p>
                <p class="answer">Most definitely! It’s been proven again and again by business after business. In fact,
                    not utilizing social media marketing can actually harm your business, since having an online
                    presence on social media is simply expected of any reputable firm these days.</p>
                <p class="question">2. What are the benefits of social media marketing for my company?</p>
                <p class="answer">Whether your business is taking advantage of it or not, social media has forever
                    changed the way that consumers communicate with businesses, and vice versa. Being accessible to your
                    customers – and your prospective clients – via social media is a vital means of developing
                    relationships with them and helping them through the sales funnel.</p>
                <p class="question">3. Which social media platforms should my business have a presence on?</p>
                <p class="answer">There is no set answer to this question, because you need to have a presence wherever
                    your customers are – and different businesses have different audiences. One demographic spends most
                    of their time on Facebook, while another really only engages on LinkedIn, and some divide their time
                    equally between three or more sites. Find out where your customers are, and follow them there.</p>
                <p class="question">4. How can I take control of my brand online through social media marketing?</p>
                <p class="answer">Taking “control” of your brand isn’t really possible anymore, thanks to social media.
                    Whether you’re in the conversation or not, people will talk about you online, and there’s no way for
                    you to “control” what they say. But what you can do is join in those conversations, and influence
                    them by being a part of them. From negative reviews on Yelp to customer complaints on Twitter, the
                    way to influence your audience’s perception of your brand is to participate in the conversations,
                    and steer them in a direction you’re happy with.</p>
                <p class="question">5. Is email marketing still effective?</p>
                <p class="answer">Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach customers
                    directly. Think about it. You’re not posting something on your site and hoping people will visit it.
                    You’re not even posting something on a social media page and hoping fans will see it. You’re sending
                    something directly into each person’s inbox, where they definitely will see it! Even if they don’t
                    open it, they’ll still see the subject line and your company’s name each time you send an email, so
                    you’re always communicating directly with your audience.</p>
                <p class="question">6. Isn’t social media marketing taking the place of email marketing?</p>
                <p class="answer">Actually, statistics show that email reaches three times more people than Facebook and
                    Twitter combined. That’s a significant difference. Social media marketing is wildly popular, and
                    becoming even more so every day, but it is definitely not taking the place of social media marketing
                    any time soon. On Facebook, for example, each post only reaches a small portion of your users. If
                    you have users opted into your email list, however, everyone on that list will receive that
                    message.</p>
                <p class="question">7. What is content marketing exactly?</p>
                <p class="answer">Content marketing turns traditional marketing on its head. Instead of focusing on a
                    company and its products or services, it focuses on the consumer’s needs first. The goal of content
                    marketing is to provide valuable, genuinely helpful information to consumers for free, in order to
                    create a relationship with them based on trust, which eventually leads them to make a purchase. </p>
                <p class="question">8. What are the steps to developing a content marketing strategy?</p>
                <p class="answer">First, determine who your target audience is. Develop a customer persona to whom your
                    content should speak. Then, based on that persona and your company’s brand image, decide on your
                    company’s voice, and the type of content you will be creating. Your content needs to be informative
                    and valuable, as well as interesting and engaging, to your target demographic. And once you start
                    producing content, constant tweaking of your strategy is in order, based on how successful each post
                    is.</p>
                <p class="question">9. How can I create content that converts?</p>
                <p class="answer">It’s important to remember that content marketing is just one step in the conversion
                    funnel. It’s only through a combination of SEO, content marketing, social media marketing, outreach,
                    email marketing, and website design that prospective customers are led to convert. That said,
                    content marketing is vital in the conversion process, since each page of your website and each
                    informative blog post or white paper plays a distinct and definite role in convincing visitors to
                    buy. Craft different content with each step of the conversion funnel in mind, and don’t forget to
                    include a solid call to action.</p>
                <p class="question">10. What are some common content marketing mistakes?</p>
                <p class="answer">The most common content marketing mistake is to fall back into the old habits of
                    traditional marketing. Writing blog posts that are overly salesy, or that promote the company and
                    its products excessively, is a big no-no. Content should be valuable to consumers, and sales pitches
                    are not only not valuable – they’re off-putting. There’s a time and a place for sales, and it’s not
                    in your content.</p>
